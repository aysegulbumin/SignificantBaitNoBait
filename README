There are 4 different things that can be done with this code.

0.Merging the Kmer Counts 

This mode is used to merge different lists that contain k-mers and counts into one list that contains all the kmers and their counts.

This mode takes at least 4 parameters.

To run this mode follow these steps.

	1. Open terminal and go to the code's directory.

	2. >make

	3. >./main 0 threshold /path/to/output/file n /path/to/input_1 /path/to/input_2 ... /path/to/input_n
		
		0 - denotes that the program is in Merging the Kmer Counts mode.

		threshold- is an integer.
			It denotes the minimum number of files that needs to have non zero value.
			(i.e if it is 1 then the output will consist of the kmers and counts that occur in at least one of the files.)
			If you do not want to restrict the output, write 1 instead of threshold.
		
		/path/to/output/file- is path to the output file.
			
		n -is an integer.
			It denotes the number of input files that one wants to merge. The parameter "n" will be followed by n number of parameters that are paths to the n input files.

		/path/to/input_x- is path to the input file.

		
	4. The results will be saved in the path provided as parameter. 
		The results are in comma separated format.
		Each column is a different input file, each row is a different kmer. Each entry in index (i,j) shows the number of occurrences of that particular kmer(i) in that particular file(j).


1.Calculating the Log Fold Change

We are using this code to find the k-mers that are significant for Bait or significant for No Bait.

Some input files are known to be bait, some input files are known to be NoBait.

Given the indices of the bait files and the no bait files in the input file.
