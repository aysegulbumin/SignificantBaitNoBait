There are 4 different things that can be done with this code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.Merging the Kmer Counts 

1.Calculating the Log Fold Change

2.Merging 2 fasta files into 1 fasta file.

3.Count given K-mers in fasta file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to Run?

1.Open terminal and go to the code's directory.

2.Run >make

3.
	Case1: Merging the Kmer Counts 
		
		Input: Threshold, N tab separated (or space separated) files.

		Output: Comma separated matrix, rows are kmers and columns are the files. Each index denotes the number of occurence of that particular kmer in that particular file.
	
		Command Line : ./main 0 threshold# /path/to/output/file n# /path/to/input_1 /path/to/input_2 ... /path/to/input_n
				
				Test: ./main 0 1 TestAll.txt 2 Sorted1.txt Sorted2.txt

				* The input files are assumed to be alphabetically sorted 
				
				Details:
				
					0 - denotes that the program is in Merging the Kmer Counts mode.

					threshold#- is an integer.
						It denotes the minimum number of files that needs to have non zero value.
						(i.e if it is 1 then the output will consist of the kmers and counts that occur in at least one of the files.)
						If you do not want to restrict the output, write 1 instead of threshold.
					n# -is an integer.
						It denotes the number of input files that one wants to merge. The parameter "n" will be followed by n number of parameters that are paths to the n input files.

		
	Case2: Calculating the Log Fold Change
		
		Input: Comma separated matrix as an input-the same as the output of Case1, Fold value which will be used as threshold, number of bait files+ number of no-bait files.
			
			* The number of bait files to consider is assumed to be equal to the number of no-bait files to consider. Hence the given number must be even.
		
		Output: Significant Bait k-mers and No-Bait k-mers in fasta format.

		Command Line:>./main 1 k bait_index1 bait_index2 ... bait_indexn nobait_index1 nobait_index2 ... nobait_indexn fold_value /path/to/input/file /path/to/Significant/BaitKmers /path/to/Significant/NoBaitKmers

			Test:
			
			Details:
	
				1- Shows that the program is in calculating the log fold change mod
				
				k- is equal to 2n here.
				
				bait_index# - is an integer and denotes the indices of bait files in the input file -denotes whether it is 1st column or 2nd or 3rd etc. There must be k/2 such indices.

				nobait_index# - is an integer and denotes the indices of no-bait files in the input file -denotes whether it is 1st column or 2nd or 3rd etc. There must be k/2 such indices.
		
				fold_value - is an integer parameter that shows which kmers to pick as significant, in most of the cases it is set to either 2 or 3. 

				*Note that it is log fold change, not direct fold change-


	Case3: Merging 2 fasta files into 1 fasta file
		
		Input : 2 fasta files
		
		Output : 1 fasta file
			
		Command Line: >./main 2 /path/to/input/file1 /path/to/input/file2 /path/to/outputfile

			Test:
		
			Details:

				2 - shows that the program is in merging 2 fasta files mode.

				The other parameters are self explanatory.			

	Case4: Count given K-mers in fasta file
	
		Input : 1 Reads file in fasta format , 1 k-mers file in fasta format

		Output : A space separated matrix consisting of integers only. The rows are the Reads and the columns are the kmers, every index represents the count of that particular kmer in that particular read.

		Command Line: >./main 3 /path/to/Read/file /path/to/Kmer/file /path/to/output/file
			
			Test:
		
			Details:
				
				3 - shows that the program is in Count given K-mers in fasta file mode.

				The other parameters are self explanatory.
	
				Both input files are expected in fasta format.
